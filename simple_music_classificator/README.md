### TODO:
  - [x] Find and download a suitable dataset: **GTZAN: 1.3GB, 1000 unique 30-sec chunks of 10 single-labeled genres**
  - [ ] `tensorflow_approach_python`: Clean Andres' Python+TF code for a working minimal example that does preprocessing, GPU-training, evaluation and plotting
  - [ ] `pytorch_approach`: Adapt TF code to work with PyTorch
  - [ ] Explore further ML frameworks (Java client for TF, ???)
  - [ ] Document installation process from clean virtual environments, and script them if possible. Also adapt to CPU?
  - [ ] Make slides (a latex template is already in the repo)


# TO RUN THIS EXAMPLES:

1. clone this repositoriy

2. To get the GTZAN whole dataset, simply visit this link: `opihi.cs.uvic.ca/sound/genres.tar.gz`. It presents the audio chunks already separated in classes (folders with the name of the genre). Download it to `<THIS_REPO>/datasets/gztan/`

3. To get the FMA-small dataset, visit this `https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_small.zip` (which will download 8GB of mp3 chunks) and this `https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip` (which will download the metadata in the form of 1GB .csv files).

3. For any of the different "approaches" of this folder, follow the indications given in the next sections


### THE `TENSORFLOW+PYTHON` APPROACH:

1. Make a clean virtual env
2. ???
3. TODO

### THE `PYTORCH` APPROACH:

1. asereje
2. ja 
3. deje
